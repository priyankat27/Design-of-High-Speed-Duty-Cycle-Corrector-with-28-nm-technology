## Abstract
High Speed Duty Cycle Corrector (DCC) is
implemented with 28nm technology using MOSFETS. The
proposed duty cycle corrector is 50% correction format. The
range for the correction of the DCC lies between 20% to 80% of
the signal. Duty cycle corrector (DCC) locks the edge rates of the
signal to achieve the 50% duty cycle and avoid detection error in
clock signal for DDR reception. The High voltage level
corresponds to “1” and low to “0” respectively. For detecting the
voltage level AC coupled circuit or DC coupled circuit with
reference level are used. Its application varies from DDR
synchronous DRAM, Double sampling ADC and many more
with collaboration with Phase lock loops



## Introduction
Circuit being proposed in this paper consists of three major
components Duty cycle adjuster (DCA) buffered with Duty
cycle Detector (DCC).</br>
